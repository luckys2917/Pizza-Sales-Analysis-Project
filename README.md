# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Project
..Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data, visualized through an interactive and dynamic Power BI dashboard. The goal is to uncover key insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational trends to support data-driven decision-making for a pizza business.

The dashboard provides a clear, at-a-glance view of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and allows for a deep dive into the data through various filters and visualizations.

..Tools & Technologies
Tool: Microsoft Power BI

Language: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Key Questions Addressed by the Dashboard
Sales Performance: What is the total revenue, total number of orders, and quantity of pizzas sold?
Sales Performance (Total Revenue, Orders, Quantity): Look for the main KPI (Key Performance Indicator) cards. These are usually displayed prominently at the top of the dashboard with large numbers.

Order Analysis: What is the average order value and the average number of pizzas per order?
(Average Order Value, Pizzas per Order): These will also likely be shown in KPI cards near the main sales figures.

Customer Preferences:

Which pizza categories (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Supreme) are the most popular?

What are the best-selling and worst-selling pizzas?
Customer Preferences (Popular Categories, Best/Worst Sellers, Sizes): Look for bar charts, donut charts, or tables. There will be visuals titled something like "Sales by Pizza Category," "Top 10 Pizzas by Revenue," or "Orders by Pizza Size." You can interact with these charts to see the exact numbers.

Which pizza sizes (S, M, L, XL, XXL) are ordered most frequently?
 This will likely be a bar chart or a donut chart with a title like "Orders by Pizza Size.
